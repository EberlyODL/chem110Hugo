Why is water a liquid?  Why does a party balloon float?  Is it true that microwaves are bad?  You’ll find an answer to these questions and more in this course!  CHEM 110 will begin by exploring the structure of an atom, and at the end of the course you will be able to explain the underlying reasons for the observed behaviors of matter.  We’ll cover topics such as atomic and molecular structure, physical properties, and chemical reactions and stoichiometry.  All the while, we will highlight how energy plays a role in chemical and physical processes. Throughout the course, you will improve your problem-solving skills by working through examples and applying concepts to real-world scenarios.  You will see a variety of examples from biology, engineering, and everyday life that highlight the importance of chemistry in the world around you.

**Course Goals:**

* Learn the language and basic tools of chemistry; gain general knowledge.

* Connect nanoscopic properties to macroscopic properties (structure affects function).

* Emphasize the role of energy in chemical and physical processes.

* Develop critical thinking and analytical problem solving skills.

* Increase student confidence in problem solving abilities.

* Incorporate graphical methods for interpreting and presenting data.

* Appreciate the value of chemistry in everyday life.


**Learning Objectives:**

_At the end of the course, students will be able to..._

* Define key terms and concepts in chemistry.

* Explain how atomic and molecular structure relates to macroscopic (observable) properties of matter

* Define the various forms of energy, explain how energy interacts with matter, and be able to calculate the energy changes associated with chemical and physical processes.

* Apply chemistry concepts to solve mathematical problems on homework, problem sets, and exams.

* Describe the chemistry behind phenomena in everyday life (i.e. why water is a liquid).
