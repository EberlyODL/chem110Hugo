I have created a scaffolded system of assignments to help you build your knowledge from the ground up.  There are three stages of assessment due on Sundays and Thursdays.

**Guiding Question Sets**
The GQS's are meant to gauge your comprehension of the content following reading of the ebook and watching associated videos.  They will assess your recall of definitions and concepts.  These are due on Sundays, so you should plan to have completed the reading and videos for the week by then.  There is no time limit and  you may attempt these up to two times.  Feel free to use your notes!


**Homework**
Homework is the second level of assessment.  Weekly HW sets are available through the ebook and are due on Thursdays.  These typically cover the previous week's content.  They are open-ended problems that will be submitted as a photo or scan to the appropriate assignment in Canvas. [Details on HW expectations and grading can be found here.](https://media.ed.science.psu.edu/sites/media/ed/files/documents/homework_expectationswc_0.pdf) 
Another great aspect of most HW problems is the paired problem.  If you don't know how to get started, take a look at the paired problem; it will have a complete solution! If you have any questions about HW problems, I encourage you to reach out to me (or any of the teaching staff) or post your question to Piazza!  


**Knowledge Checks**
The final check is a Knowledge Check.  These will be due on Sundays.  These are optional, but I do offer an incentive to complete these (as explained in the "Borderline Grade" policy in the syllabus).  Here, you will be taking exam-type questions that mix in concepts and mathematical problems.


**Exams**
We will have four mid-term exams and a final this semester.  Exams will be proctored through Examity and consist of open-ended problems and short-answer questions. You will have the opportunity to show what you know and earn partial credit! :)
