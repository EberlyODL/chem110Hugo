**[eBook](https://genchem.science.psu.edu/offering/18/news-and-updates "CHEM 110 eBook")**
Chemistry faculty at University Park have written an e-book that we will use as the textbook for this course.  Beyond text, the e-book has sample problems for practice within the margins of each page.  They even contain a full solution you can use as a check.  You will also find interactive figures and short demo videos embedded throughout.  
The homework sets will also be hosted in the e-book.  You'll find links to the  homework within each "Week X" page here in ELMS. 

**Videos**
In this course, there will be several types of videos.  I encourage you to take notes during the videos just as you would if you were attending a lecture.

* The lecture-style videos are recorded in Penn State's One Button Studio.  These 5-10 minute videos are intended to introduce concepts and terms.  During these videos, you should be active and take notes.  There may be points where you are asked to answer a question.  These questions are not graded and provide a more engaging experience.

* Solved-problem videos will walk you through a method for solving a particular problem.  You will likely be asked to try this problem for yourself before watching the video.  Give it your best shot - the stakes will never be lower!  There may be other paths to solving a particular problem, so feel free to let me know if you arrived at an answer by a different method.



**Recitation**
Recitations will one-hour meetings with 3-6 other students in the course.  We will schedule these during the first week and begin meetings in week 2.  Two learning assistants will be logged on to help guide you and your teammates through solving problems.  Recitation worksheets will be available on each "Week X" page.

**Problem Sets**
Even more practice problems are available in Problem Sets.  Each problem set contains exam-level questions and are intended to be used as preparation for the exam.  These are completely optional.

**Piazza**
If you have any content-related questions, please do not hesitate to post them on [Piazza](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/1866869/external_tools/195053)! The instructional staff will monitor this to get you an answer as soon as possible.  Other students can even answer questions that can be approved.  When someone asks a question, everyone can benefit!
