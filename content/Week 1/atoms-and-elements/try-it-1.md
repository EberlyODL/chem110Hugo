A "Try it!" page is an opportunity for you to practice.  In my residential courses, I use clicker questions, where students use a remote to select an answer option to a question.   These embedded h5p questions are your version of a clicker question.  This gives you, the student, an opportunity to test yourself.  It also gives me data on concepts that students may be struggling with.  You are not graded on correctness, but only on participation.  I will be able to use the response data to tailor instruction (i.e. provide additional resources) as we move through the semester and make changes for future offerings of the course.
